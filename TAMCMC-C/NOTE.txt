in config.cpp: need to work on the function around line 426

NEED TO BE DONE:
 0. Investigate the following error (probably due to capital letters...):
 	Unrecognized name for prior_fct_name=io_MS_Global
         The name of priors MUST BE those on the following list:
              - 'prior_Test_Gaussian'
              - 'prior_Harvey_Gaussian'
              - 'io_MS_Global (handling I/O for Main-Sequence star models) '
	Check the configuration file
	The program will stop now


 1. Implement the model/prior/likelihood listing handling into the error messages
 2. Extend the association between name and case to the statistical priors database
