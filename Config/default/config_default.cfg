# Configuration File for the TAMCMC-C++

!MALA:
	# Variables that control the Metropolis-Hasting and Truncated Langevin scheme
	# algorithm, the adaptive process of the proposal law and the parallel tempering
	
	# ----------- Controls for the Adaptive process -----------
	target_acceptance=0.234;
	c0=10;  Relaxation constrain. Important: Adjust empirically. Guideline: Large dimensionality requires c0~2. Small dimensionality requires c0~5-10
	epsilon1=1e-12;  Bundary for the Robins-Monroe stochastic algorithm. Must be as small as the numerical precision of the machine. With long double, can THEORITICALLY be 1e-19 (1e-16 for double)
	epsilon2=1e-12;
	A1=1e14;  Bundary for the Robins-Monroe stochastic algorithm. Must be as large as the numerical precision of the machine allows.
	# Define zones where Learning is made in different ways
	Nt_learn=1000, 2500, 100000;   DO NOT LEARN BELLOW THE FIRST VALUE OR AFTER THE LAST VALUE
	periods_learn=1, 1;  if Nt_learn[0]< i <Nt_learn[1], learn every 5 times, etc... THIS MUST BE OF size=Nt_learn.size()-1

	# ---------------- Controls for the MALA  -----------------
	use_drift=0;  When 0, use the MH scheme instead of the MALA scheme ; NOT IMPLEMENTED
	delta=0;  This parameter is only for the MALA algorithm (ie, when the gradient is available). For a RWM, set to 0... ; NOT IMPLEMENTED
	delta_x=1e-10;  Boundary for the MALA... not used for the RWM mode ; NOT IMPLEMENTED
 
 	# ----------- Controls for the parallel tempering ---------
 	Nchains=5;   Number of parallel chains
	dN_mixing=1.;  Perform a chain mixing (parallel tempering) every dN_mixing
 	lambda_temp=1.7; value should always be adjusted so that 120<Tmax<200

	# --------- Experimental extra parameters ----------
	# ------ These are not yet fully implemented ------
	proposal_type=Random; Exact_on_grid does not yet exist // PARTLY IMPLEMENTED
	

!Modeling:

	# This section contains the required information to (1) compute 
	# the models, (2) calculate the likelihood and (3) calculate the priors
	
	#submodel_from_model_file=1;  If set to 0: Use values of model_fct_name and prior_fct_name hereafter. If set to 1: model_fct_name and prior_fct_name give the class of model. The fullname of the model must be in .model file
	#model_fct_name=model_MS_Global_a1etaa3_HarveyLike; Name of the function that contains the model. Currently available: model_Test_Gaussian, model_Harvey_Gaussian
	#model_fct_name=model_MS_Global_a1l_etaa3_HarveyLike; MODEL WITHOUT THE S11=S22 ASSUMPTION ... THIS IS AUTOMATICALLY HANDLED NOW
	#model_fct_name=model_MS_Global_a1n_etaa3_HarveyLike; model with the S11=S22 ASSUMPTION BUT FREE IN n
	#model_fct_name=model_MS_Global_a1nl_etaa3_HarveyLike; MODEL COMPLETELY FREE IN n AND l
	prior_fct_name=io_ms_Global; Name of the function that contains the methods to generate the inputs and outputs for your model. e.g io_ms_global(.cpp) handles the model names and the fits of MS stars.
	model_fct_name=io_ms_Global; // Useless in most situations (except for dev/debug). This because prior_fct_name defines it automatically (value is superseed). model_MS_Global; // Master name... when used with inputs_from_model_file=1, the submodel must be present in the .model file 

	likelihood_fct_name=chi(2,2p); Name of the function that will calculate the likelihood. two choices: "chi_square" or "chi(2,2p)"
	
	likelihood_params=1; Parameters that could define the likelihood. e.g., in the case of a chi(2,2p) statistics (chi22p function), we need p

	#cfg_model_file=/home/obenomar/Dropbox/Temporary/Project-Measure_a1a2a3_MS/Cpp-TAMCMC-v1.1.2/Config/inputs/model_Test_Gaussian/Gaussian.model; Contains the initial guesses and the priors in an ASCII format. To each model_fct_name, a given format is expected. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO NAME YOUR FILE WITH THE SAME NAME AS THE PRIOR_FCT_NAME

	# class Outputs (files output.cpp and output.h)

	Nbuffer=5000;

	erase_old_files=1;  if set to 0, it appends the existing files (if any exist)
	file_format=binary;  "text" or "binary". Alternatively, "debug" is to generate both type of files (to compare outputs from both files)

	#  -----------  Variables that decide which outputs we do write  ----------- 
	get_params=1;  if set to 1, save the parameters of the fitted model. This option might always be set to 1
	get_statcriteria=1;  if set to 1, save the statistical parameters (logLikelihood, logPrior, logPosterior, ...). Recommended to always set it to 1
	get_proposal_params=0;  if set to 1, save the proposal parameters (sigmas, mus, covarmats) of the parallel chains. Mostly for debug purpose.
	get_parallel_tempering=1; if set to 1, save the parallel tempering information (swaped chain, probability, ...)
	get_models=0;  if set to 1, save the models for all chains. WARNING: Might greatly slow-down the process and will take a HUGE amount of space. AUTOMATICALLY DEACTIVATED IF TOO LARGE DATASET

	do_restore_proposal=0; If set to 1, restore the proposal law (covariance matrix) of a previous run
	do_restore_variables=0; If set to 1, restore the last values for variables of a previous run
	do_restore_proposal_mean=0; If set to 1, DO NOT restore the last value for the proposal BUT restore the average proposal law (over Nbuffer) as stored in the restore file. Often better to use the mean for the Acquire phase (more accurate covariance matrix)

	#restore_dir=/home/obenomar/Dropbox/Temporary/Project-Measure_a1a2a3_MS/Cpp-TAMCMC-v1.1.3.1/Data/restore/; The directory where all files required to restore a run are put.

	# When the model_*_diags are set to 1, it is possible to show the data and/or a smooth of the data. Two level of smooth can be overploted
	# data_scoef1 and data_scoef2. Note that these coefficient should be in the same unit as the x-axis of the data (e.g. microHz or seconds)
